`kgpy` (Kankelborg Group Python) is a library being developed by Charles Kankelborg's research group at Montana State University.
This library aims to provide general tools and utilities that can be used for the instrument-focused libraries such as [esis](https://github.com/Kankelborg-Group/ESIS).
See the [documentation](https://kgpy.readthedocs.io/) for a detailed description of the API and instructions for using 
the various packages in this library.
